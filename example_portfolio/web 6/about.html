                <p1>
                    Known as the <i>great and mighty <b>Lea Goretoy</b></i> by many, and a slightly too energetic character
                    by many more. I found that I enjoyed coding through middle schoo; whem taking an extracurricular activity during 8<sub>th</sub> grade.
                    I feel that it makes sense, seeing that my dad prgrams <i>machine code</i> for <b>Micron</b> and my brother also graduated <b>CWI</b>
                    with a <i>tech degree.</i></p1>
            <h2>Huh!? Why Software Development?</h2>
                <p2>
                    Many have told me they find it rather odd that I went for a software development instead of an <b>art</b> degree, seeing how I have been <i>drawing and painting </i>
                    from when I was 11. However, I truly do like the whole aspect of software development. There is room to be <i>creative</i>, as well as <i>problem solve,</i>
                    working with people, and getting to type a lot (I dont know why but I feel like typing is very therapeutic).</p2>
            <h3>It is Not Worth it</h3>
                <p3>
                    As I am sure many are aware, the <b>technical industry</b> is looking a little <i>scary</i> right now. Lots of people are fighting for tech work, and a lot of graduates
                    feel like they can not fimd a job in the industry. <i><q>You're doing all of this, and you will end up working as a barista, trust me,</q></i> I've heard. Jokes on them, 
                    I <b>love</b> being a barista, you're telling me I get to <i>both</i> have a degree in software development and get to work my favorite job? Sounds right up my ally good sir!
