   <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
  <div id="accordion">
    <h3>What inspired this company?</h3>
    <div>
      <img class="photo" src="media/profile.png" alt="Kyle and his friends dog" width="250" height="250">
      <p>
        Our company was created based off a bet! The company owner, Kyle, was drunk one night when he admitted to his best friend Jay that he could train Jay's dog to be a fire DJ. Jay expressed "Nu-uh" and Kyle took that personally. "If I train your dog to DJ then I get to keep him and take your girlfriend out on a date. If I lose, I owe you $1000." Jay agreed and the rest is history. Kyle trained the dog to DJ and the dog was a hit at every party. Kyle then decided to start a company based off of this idea. He has since then taken Jay's girlfriend out on a date and they are now married. Jay is still waiting for his $1000 and is still single. The photo is of Kyle and the dog, who is now a professional DJ!

    <h3>What dogs are available?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        We have a small selection of dogs available for rent. We are continually changing our rotation of dogs that are available. We take pride in making sure the pups we have are properly taken care of! We also add any dogs that have successfully passed training. Please keep in mind, all of our dogs are professionally trained and it takes years to perfect. Please let us know if there is a dog that you would like to have available! This company is always looking to expand our selection.

    <h3>What songs are the dogs limited to?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        We have a wide selection of songs that our dogs are able to DJ at your event. Any one of our dogs can play any song that you would prefer. Certain pups do have a certain liking to certain genres, so we strongly recommend choosing based on that for the best experience. Please let us know if you have a specific song that you would like to have played at your event. Explicit songs are allowed, as our dogs have not learned to swear yet. Please keep in mind that if they do learn to swear, we will not be held responsible for any damages that may occur.

    <h3>Can my dog be trained to become a Dawg DJ?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        We are always looking for new dogs to join our team! If you think your dog has what it takes to become a Dawg DJ, please contact us! We will have a trainer come out to your location and see if your dog has what it takes. If your dog is accepted into our program, we will train them to become part of the team. Please keep in mind that not all dogs are accepted into our program. We are looking for dogs that are well behaved and have a good sense of rhythm. Please let us know if you are interested in letting your pup become part of the best thing that has happened in this country! (At least since the American singer and rapper Pitbull was born!)
